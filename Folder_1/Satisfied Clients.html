                    I first sought out Saul Goodman for his legal expertise in a business matter. He had a natural charm that made me feel instantly at ease. Knowing I could trust him, I shared a very personal story concerning my life-altering cancer diagnosis. 
                    Once Saul was aware of my illness, he offered a free estate planning consultation (a $299 value) to help secure my family's future.
                    His brilliant plan will ensure that my family is taken care of even if the worst happens. I can't thank Saul enough.

                   I got the ever living shit kicked out of me. I was afraid to go after the scumbags who did it but Saul knew some people that could help. He got me paid bitches!

                   I got picked up for some drug shit in a wrongful arrest. Saul knew those drugs weren't mine and told me to shut up and stop telling the cops stuff they didn't need to know. 
                   He got me out of jail hella fast.

                    Working with Mr. Goodman was an experience. 
                    He is certainly not the attorney we envisioned for ourselves, but we suppose one does not always get to choose how justice is servedâ€”only that it is served.
